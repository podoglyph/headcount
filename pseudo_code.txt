Iteration 1

The District object needs to know where to find its relative Enrollment object. So, in the DR, each District needs to point to an Enrollment object within the ER.

district.enrollment.kindergarten_participation_in_year(2010) # => 0.436

<District: @name = "Colorado" @repo = DR>

def enrollment
  @name
  #1. when DR is created ER is also created with loaded data.
  2. the District object needs a reference to the DR, which can then find the appropriate Enrollment object.
  3. access the ER#find_by_name to find relative Enrollment object
  4. Use that Enrollment object to call #kindergarten_participation_by_year
  5. return the data for the year.
end

<Enrollment: @name = "Colorado", @kindergarten_participation={2007=>0.39159, 2006=>0.35364, 2005=>0.26709, 2004=>0.30201, 2008=>0.38456>
